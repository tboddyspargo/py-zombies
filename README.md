# py-zombies
A zombie apocalypse game written in python 2.7 using pygame 1.9.2pre.

# Goal
Survive the zombie apocalypse until the rescue team  arrives to save you! You can avoid the zombies by staying far enough away from them, or by killing them. You only have a limited amount of bullets, but don't panic; you'll occasionally find extra ammunition around the map. As time goes on your zombie opponents will be faster, come more frequently and be harder to kill, but you’ll find bullets more frequently and you yourself can slowly gain more health, too. The longer you live and the more zombies you kill, the more points you rack up. Can you survive for 5 minutes?!
